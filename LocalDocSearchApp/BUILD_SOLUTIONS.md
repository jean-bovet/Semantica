# Build Solutions for LocalDocSearch

## Current Status

The original `build.sh` script fails due to py2app incompatibility with Python 3.13. Here are three working alternatives:

## Solution 1: Simplified Build (build_simple.sh) âœ… WORKING

**Status:** Successfully builds and runs
**Method:** Creates a basic app bundle with system Python
**Pros:** Simple, works immediately
**Cons:** Requires users to have Python and dependencies installed

```bash
./build_simple.sh
open LocalDocSearch.app
```

## Solution 2: PyInstaller Build (build_pyinstaller.sh) 

**Status:** Script created, ready to test
**Method:** Bundles Python and all dependencies into a self-contained app
**Pros:** No Python installation required for end users
**Cons:** Larger app size (~500MB)

```bash
./build_pyinstaller.sh
open LocalDocSearch.app
```

## Solution 3: Python 3.11 with py2app

**Status:** Not implemented yet
**Method:** Use Python 3.11 which is compatible with py2app
**Pros:** Official Apple-recommended bundling method
**Cons:** Requires switching Python versions

```bash
# Install Python 3.11
brew install python@3.11

# Create venv with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv_py311
source venv_py311/bin/activate

# Run original build.sh
./build.sh
```

## Recommended Approach

For immediate use: **Solution 1 (build_simple.sh)**
- Quick to build
- Works well for development
- Swift launcher successfully compiles

For distribution: **Solution 2 (PyInstaller)**
- Self-contained app
- No dependencies for users
- Professional distribution

## Next Steps

1. Test PyInstaller build:
   ```bash
   ./build_pyinstaller.sh
   ```

2. If PyInstaller works well, integrate it with Swift UI:
   - Modify PythonBridge.swift to call PyInstaller bundle
   - Update build process to combine Swift UI with PyInstaller backend

3. Consider client-server architecture:
   - Python server running locally
   - Swift UI communicating via localhost API
   - Cleaner separation of concerns
