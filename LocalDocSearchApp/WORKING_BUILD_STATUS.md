# Working Build Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Simplified App Bundle** (`LocalDocSearch.app`)
   - Built with `build_simple.sh`
   - Opens and shows app structure
   - Can be launched with: `open LocalDocSearch.app`

2. **Swift Package Build**
   - Compiles successfully with `swift build`
   - All Swift code is valid and builds without errors
   - Creates executable at `.build/debug/LocalDocSearch`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

1. **PythonKit Runtime**
   - The Swift executable needs Python runtime configuration
   - PythonKit requires proper Python environment setup
   - Error: "No module named 'encodings'" when running directly

## üìã Solutions

### For Development/Testing

Use the simplified app:
```bash
open LocalDocSearch.app
```

### For Full Functionality

Use the Python CLI version:
```bash
cd ../local-doc-search
python cli.py interactive
```

### To Fix PythonKit Integration

Options:
1. **Use PyInstaller approach** - Bundle Python completely
2. **Client-Server Architecture** - Python server + Swift client
3. **Embed Python.framework** - Requires more complex bundling

## üéØ Recommendation

The current simplified app demonstrates the UI structure. For production:
1. Use the PyInstaller approach for self-contained distribution
2. Or implement a client-server architecture with Python backend

The Swift code is solid and compiles correctly - the issue is only with Python runtime integration.
