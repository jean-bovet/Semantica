Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x), you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.

Applications of Machine Learning:

- Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language
- Computer Vision: Image recognition and processing
- Recommendation Systems: Personalized content suggestions
- Fraud Detection: Identifying suspicious transactions
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
- Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars and drones

Python has become the de facto language for machine learning due to its simplicity and the vast ecosystem of libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
